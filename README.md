The Sabertooth SSH monitoring tool allows users to track all incoming SSH access attempts by live
monitoring their SSH server's log file. Originating locations for each connection are determined
and plotted on a world-map as attempts are made. Additional breakdowns of attempts by country,
time, and username are also available.
